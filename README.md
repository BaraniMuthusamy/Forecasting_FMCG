Forecasting Demand in FMCG
Forecasting Demand in FMCG â€“ A Recent Project
Accurate demand forecasting is essential for maintaining the right inventory levels and avoiding stockouts or excess stock. I recently worked on a time series forecasting project using ARIMA and SARIMAX models to predict FMCG sales trends.
Key Highlights:
 Collected and preprocessed historical sales data
 Visualized trends to understand seasonality and demand patterns
 Built and evaluated forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMAX)
 Measured accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
 Generated future demand forecasts to support inventory planning
By leveraging these models, I was able to predict future sales trends, helping businesses make better stocking decisions and minimize revenue loss.
